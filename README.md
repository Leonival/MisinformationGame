------------------------------------------------------

The Misinformation Game is a social media simulator built to study
people's behaviour when they interact with social media. To achieve
this, The Misinformation Game simulates a social media feed for
research participants. Participants will be shown either a feed of
social media posts, or a single social media post at a time, and
they may then react to the post and its comments. The Misinformation
Game has been designed to be highly customisable so that tightly
controlled experiences can be created for participants. This
customisability is a core focus of The Misinformation Game,
to facilitate the research of a wide array of social media
related questions.

- Customisable engagement metric information.
- Configurable prompt to be shown to participants before they
  begin participating in a study.
- Configurable introduction, game rules, and debriefing screens to be shown
  to participants before and after they complete a study.
- Ability to generate unique completion codes for participants.
- Rich recording of participants' interactions to allow analysis of their behavior.
