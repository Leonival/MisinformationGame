------------------------------------------------------

The Misinformation Game is a social-media simulator built to study
how people interact with information on social-media. To achieve
this, The Misinformation Game simulates a social-media feed for
research participants. Participants are shown fake social-media
posts, either one at a time or in a feed format. They may then
react to the posts and their comments. The Misinformation Game has
been designed to be highly customisable so that a range of tightly
controlled experiences can be created for participants. This
customisability is a core focus of The Misinformation Game, to
facilitate the research of a wide array of social-media related
questions.
