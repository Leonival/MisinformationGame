# Misinformation Game Documentation
This directory contains several documents outlining the
way that The Misinformation Game works, and how it can
be used to conduct studies.

### Installation
A guide on how to deploy your own instance of The
Misinformation Game at your own custom URL is
described in the [Installation.md](Installation.md)
document. At the end of this guide, you will have
your own website hosted at your own custom URL,
(e.g. https://misinformation-game.web.app).

### Registering Administrators
A guide on registering administrators, and a description
of their privileges, can be found in the
[Administrators.md](Administrators.md) document. Users
without administrator privileges will not be able to
create new studies.

### Study Configuration
The method of creating studies is described in the
[StudyConfiguration.md](StudyConfiguration.md) document.
The guide explains how to copy the template to start
creating a new study, a description of all the settings
contained within the configuration spreadsheet, and
a guide on how to upload your study to your deployment
of The Misinformation Game.

### Simulation
A description of the simulation that the participants
interact with is described in the
[Simulation.md](Simulation.md) document. This document
includes a description of how the credibility and
followers of sources and participants changes throughout
games, as well as an in-depth description of how the
sources and posts are chosen to show to the participant.

### Results
The results that are generated after participants have
interacted with a study are described in the
[Results.md](Results.md) document. This document
describes what each value in the results represents,
how they were recorded, and how they may be
used in analysis.

### Development Environment
Setting up the development environment to work on The
Misinformation Game is described in the
[Development.md](Development.md) document. If you wish
to program new features into The Misinformation Game,
this is the best place to start.

### System Architecture
The system architecture of how The Misinformation Game
functions is described in the
[SystemArchitecture.md](SystemArchitecture.md) document.
This includes an overview of the technologies used in
the project, and the data-flows within the application.

### Original Design
The original design that was made before The Misinformation
Game was developed can be found in
[original-design/DESIGN.md](original-design/DESIGN.md).
This design is not representative of the current state of
the application, however it was the starting point for
this whole project and is therefore kept for posterity.
