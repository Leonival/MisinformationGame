You can read the documentation for The Misinformation Game at
[https://themisinformationgame.github.io](https://themisinformationgame.github.io).
This repository contains the source code for that website.

This repository corresponds directly to the `/docs/` directory in the
[MisinformationGame repository](https://github.com/TheMisinformationGame/MisinformationGame).
Changes should first be made there, and
then they can be pushed here afterwards (to maintain the
[MisinformationGame repo](https://github.com/TheMisinformationGame/MisinformationGame
as the ground-truth repository).
