## 2. The Fundamentals
{:#fundamentals}

Fundamentally, the Misinformation Game is a tool to present
information to participants, elicit responses from them, and
then to provide dynamic feedback to them based upon their
responses. The information presented can take the form of
text or image posts, and comments. The responses from
participants can constitute either reactions to posts, or
comments on them. And, the dynamic feedback takes the form
of changes to the follower count and credibility number
of participants based upon their responses. All of these
major components of the Misinformation Game also have a
high degree of customisation for you to tailor them for
your research. Additionally, the reactions, comments and
dynamic feedback can also be disabled entirely if you
don't need them.

The presented information may include text
or images, and the responses of participants may include
comments or social reactions. For example, you may present a
participant with a photo of a cat, and they may like that photo
and comment "CUTE!". This information that is presented to
participants is organised into posts, to emulate social media.
Additionally, you may have also noticed in an example game that
you have a follower count and credibility number that changed
throughout the game based upon your reactions. This dynamic
feedback is a large
